# Commutative Algebra

An attempt to introducing the integral closure of ideals, and the tight closure of
ideals.

See the [blueprint](https://provables.github.io/commutative-algebra/).

## Usage

Start a development environment with `nix develop`.

Run `task -a` to see all the tasks available. The common ones are:
